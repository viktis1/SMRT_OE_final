Implement the interface boundary condition under IEM formulation provided by Fung et al. 1992. in IEEE TGRS 
with an extended domain of validity (for large roughness or correlation length) by switching the Fresnel 
coefficients according to Brogioni et al. 2010, IJRS (doi: 10.1080/01431160903232808). A better but more
complex approach is given by Wu et al. 2003 (to be implemented).

Use of this code requires special attention.
